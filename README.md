# Eric's 128x32_OLED_SSD1306 Stuff

Eric is slow and needs to have his own repos for basic OLED stuff or he forgets EVERYTHING between projects.

Repo is my storage for examples and basic project code using the Adafruit Library for this nifty little OLED DISPLAY.

All credit remains to Adafruit in the code files.
